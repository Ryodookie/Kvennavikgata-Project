# Blender BIM Kvennavikgata Project

This is a demonstration project primarily built with the [Blender BIM addon]( https://blenderbim.org ) and a 3D scanned version of my apartment.
The primary goal of this project is to investigate Blender's potential for unconventional tasks, such as parametric modeling and engineering, alongside exploring the capabilities of the Blender BIM addon for creating floorplans.

## Areas of interest include:

+ Focusing on learning about the use of BIM standards, including IFC class formats, and their integration into model construction.
+ Exploring possible parametric modeling and CAD capabilities of the addon.
+ Investigating 2D line drawing capabilities, including creating annotations, symbols and elevation drawings.
